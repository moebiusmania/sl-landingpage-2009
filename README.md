> Simple starter kit boilerplate based on Webpack, SASS and Bootstrap 5 (beta)

Built on top of my [frontend-starter-kit](https://github.com/mohole/frontend-starter-kit).

## Source material
I've only had the compiled Flash Player `temp.swf` file available, but luckily for me I was able to de-compile it thanks to the awesome [jpexs-decompiler](https://github.com/jindrapetrik/jpexs-decompiler) tool the allowed me to get the original ActionScript code, the vector images and the objects data.

In the `./src` folder I've added all of the available source material:
* the original `temp.swf` file
* in the `/as_source` the ActionScript files I've written back in the days
